US indices declined, with the $S&P 500 falling 0.33% and the $Nasdaq 100 down 0.34%, primarily driven by weakness in chip and data storage stocks. European stocks were also slightly lower, with the Euro Stoxx 50 easing 0.08%, while China's Shanghai Composite showed resilience, climbing 0.1% following stronger-than-expected December Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI data. The unexpected drop in US weekly jobless claims to a one-month low was a hawkish factor contributing to higher bond yields and pressure on equities.\n\n\ud83d\udcbc PORTFOLIO FOCUS\n\nThe AI and Semiconductor cohort, including $NVDA, $TSM, $AVGO, $MSFT, $SNPS, $AMZN, and $GOOG, faced selling pressure, as chip stocks led the broader $Nasdaq decline.

The focus has entirely shifted to policy announcements and economic forecasts for the year ahead, with all eyes now on the first trading session of 2026 tomorrow. Asian markets, including the Shanghai Composite, also observed the holiday, leaving volume at negligible levels worldwide. The lack of trading volume has led analysts to issue numerous sector outlooks, setting the stage for tomorrow\u2019s open.\n\n\ud83d\udcbc PORTFOLIO FOCUS\n\nWith markets closed, attention is on the 2026 outlook for key sectors. The Healthcare cohort, including $AZN.L, $ABT, $ABBV, $LLY, and $NOVO-B.CO, is poised for continued growth based on new product pipelines and a strong M&A environment, with particular momentum expected in obesity and immunology treatments.

The $S&P 500 and $Euro Stoxx saw no activity, with attention shifting to overnight commodity moves. The $Shanghai Composite, however, provided a final data point, managing a slight gain, closing up 0.1% at 3,968.84.
