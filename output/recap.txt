🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

Global markets saw a mixed and volatile start to the new year, with US indices giving up early gains to close lower while European markets continued their rally. The $S&P 500 fell -0.74% and the $Nasdaq 100 lost -0.84%, sliding to 1.5-week lows on weakness in megacap technology stocks and rising bond yields. US initial unemployment claims unexpectedly fell to a one-month low of 199,000, which drove the 10-year Treasury yield higher, acting as a headwind for equities. Conversely, the $Euro Stoxx 50 rallied to a new all-time high, with the $FTSE 100 also hitting an intraday record, buoyed by broad optimism. In Asia, China's December Manufacturing PMI rose to 50.1, signaling the fastest expansion in nine months, though the $Shanghai Composite saw only a marginal gain of +0.09%.

💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

The AI and Semiconductor space was highly volatile; chip makers like $NVDA and $GOOG initially surged over 2% on AI optimism, but this was offset by a late-day pullback. Megacap tech names, including $MSFT and $AMZN, notably dropped 2-5% on concerns and scrutiny over exaggerated capital expenditure pledges in AI infrastructure. European-focused holdings like $SX7PEX.DE (European Banks ETF) and $IEUR benefited from the $Euro Stoxx 50's all-time high and a rise in European bond yields, with the 10-year German bund yield climbing to a 1.5-week high. Hong Kong-listed stocks, including $1919.HK and $2318.HK, saw a strong rally as the Hang Seng jumped 2.8%, with e-commerce giants climbing over 4%. Additionally, mining and materials stocks like $GLEN.L were supported by a surge in precious metals miners, which helped propel the $FTSE 100 to an intraday record.
