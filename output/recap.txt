🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

Global markets kicked off the new year with a broad risk-on rally, led by a strong resurgence in technology and growth stocks. US indices rebounded from a four-day losing streak, with the $Nasdaq Composite jumping over 1% and the $S&P 500 gaining about 0.5% in early trading. European equities hit a fresh record high, as the pan-European $Euro Stoxx 600 climbed 0.6% and the UK's FTSE 100 surpassed the symbolic 10,000 level for the first time. While Mainland China markets were closed, the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index (HSI) soared 2.76%, driven by renewed optimism in the domestic AI sector.

💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

The Healthcare sector saw major catalysts as $NOVO-B.CO surged 4.5% following positive Phase 2 trial data for its experimental weight-loss/diabetes drug, amycretin. $AZN.L also gained 2% after its drug Imfinzi received US approval for use in combination therapy for early-stage gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers. Sentiment for the AI and Semiconductor sector was firmly positive, with bellwethers like $NVDA and $AVGO seeing pre-market gains that contributed to the $Nasdaq's strong open. Chinese technology names, including those held in $IEMG, experienced a significant tailwind from the Hang Seng's massive rally, which was fueled by AI optimism and news of Baidu's $GOOG-rivaling Kunlunxin chip unit spin-off plan. Financial stocks like $DB1.DE and $PYPL, along with European defense and basic resource holdings, were supported by the overall positive sentiment and inflows into the record-breaking $Euro Stoxx 600.
