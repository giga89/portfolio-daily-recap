🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

Global markets ended the day with mixed results, characterized by a US pullback contrasting with modest gains in Asia and neutral European trade. The $S&P 500 fell 0.35% and the $Nasdaq Composite declined 0.50% as investors engaged in profit-taking, particularly in high-flying technology stocks. European equities showed resilience in the face of US weakness, with the pan-European $Euro Stoxx 600 closing relatively unchanged after trading near its intraday record high. Asia was slightly positive, with the $Shanghai Composite posting a modest gain of 0.16% as investors awaited the release of the Federal Reserve's December meeting minutes.

💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

The AI-driven megacap sector experienced a wave of profit-taking, with $NVDA falling over 1.21%, alongside $AMZN, $GOOG, $MSFT, and $TSM, which all saw mild declines, signaling a slight consolidation after a strong annual run. The nuclear energy thesis remains robust as Uranium spot prices rebounded 0.68% to $81.95/Lbs, providing tailwinds for producers like $CCJ. In Europe, utility $ENEL.MI continues to push its strategic plan, committing over €38 billion to grid modernization and adding 12 GW of new renewables capacity through 2027. Hong Kong-listed $1919.HK (COSCO Shipping Holdings) announced a share buyback on December 29 for 3.46 million shares worth 47.9 million HKD, a move often viewed positively by the market. Meanwhile, the broader industrial metal complex provides support for miners like $GLEN.L, as copper is heading for its longest winning run since 2017.
