🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

European markets provided a strong counter-narrative to the US pullback, with the $DAX Index advancing 0.57% and the $Euro Stoxx 50 gaining 0.77% in a robust year-end close. US markets saw a continuation of marginal profit-taking in the final session, with the $S&P 500 easing 0.14% and the $Nasdaq Composite slipping 0.24%. Asian indices opened mixed, with the Shanghai Composite seeing minimal movement while the Hang Seng Index retreated over 1% on the last day of trading.

💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

The megacap technology sector saw continued year-end profit-taking, impacting major holdings like $NVDA, $MSFT, and $AMZN, as investors locked in gains from the AI-driven rally that fueled the $Nasdaq slip. Healthcare names $LLY and $NOVO-B.CO are consolidating after their strong run, with market attention shifting to 2026 pipeline developments and regulatory clarity. European exchange operator $DB1.DE and luxury auto firm $RACE may benefit from the regional strength seen in the $DAX close. Chinese financials $2318.HK and $1919.HK are under pressure following the morning decline in the Hang Seng Index, reflecting cautious sentiment in the region.
