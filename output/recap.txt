🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

US stock futures are pointing lower to begin the holiday-shortened week, with $S&P 500 futures down 0.3% and $NDAQ 100 futures slipping 0.5% as investors lock in recent gains. European markets were muted and mixed in quiet trading, with the FTSE 100 up slightly while the $DAX 40 remained flat. In China, the government announced it will lower provisional import tariff rates on 935 products, including advanced materials and medical goods, starting in 2026 to boost high-quality domestic supply.

💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

The Technology sector is seeing profit-taking, with AI leader $NVDA pulling back about 2% in early trading, alongside modest declines for other mega-cap and semiconductor names like $AVGO and $TSM. The Healthcare sector remains in focus as $LLY and $NOVO-B.CO continue to dominate headlines regarding GLP-1 drug competition and oral delivery innovation. Mining and resources giants $BHP.L and $GLEN are supported by rising copper and iron ore prices, driven by supply constraints and long-term demand from electrification projects. Chinese stocks, including $1919.HK and $2318.HK, may see tailwinds from the government's decision to lower import tariffs on advanced materials and medical goods from January 2026. Oil prices are surging more than 2% amid heightening geopolitical tensions between the US and Venezuela, impacting energy-exposed holdings like $GLEN.
