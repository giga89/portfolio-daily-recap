🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

Global equities closed the year-end on a mixed note amid thin holiday volumes and profit-taking in the US. The $S&P 500 and $Nasdaq Composite both slipped around 0.3% and 0.5% respectively, primarily driven by declines in major technology names. European markets, led by the $Euro Stoxx 600, showed resilience, closing marginally higher or relatively unchanged as banking stocks saw modest gains. Asia was mixed, with China's $Shanghai Composite holding steady while Hong Kong's $Hang Seng index climbed 0.9% on regional strength.

💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

The AI/Tech sector is consolidating, with $NVDA and $MSFT under pressure from profit-taking, while major news saw $GOOG agree to purchase Intersect Power for $4.75 billion to secure energy capacity for its expanding cloud and AI infrastructure. In Healthcare, the GLP-1 competition remains a focus as $LLY faces continuing competitive pressure following the recent approval of an oral version of $NOVO-B.CO's Wegovy, giving the Danish firm a head start in the pill-based obesity market. Uranium stock $CCJ is supported by fresh analyst coverage highlighting its role as a key Western supplier ramping up Tier 1 assets to meet nuclear demand fueled by AI data centers and energy security. Finally, the European banking ETF $SX7PEX.DE is trading ex-dividend today, while other Financials like $DB1.DE and $PYPL are trading in line with the quiet, mixed European and US markets.
