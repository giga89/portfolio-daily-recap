🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

**🌍 MARKET OVERVIEW**
Asian markets were mixed in quiet trading, though China's $Shanghai Composite posted a modest gain of 0.3% despite rising geopolitical tensions related to military drills near Taiwan. European stock futures are pointing slightly higher as the region resumes trading for a shortened holiday week, with the $Euro Stoxx 50 expected to open with a positive bias. US equity futures are largely flat in thin pre-market trade, following the previous week's record highs. In commodities, crude oil advanced, with Brent crude topping $60 per barrel, while silver continued its recent rally with a 3% jump.

**💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS**
The AI/Semiconductor sector remains a key driver, with SEMI projecting global equipment sales to reach a record $133 billion in 2025, providing a strong tailwind for $NVDA, $TSM, $AVGO, and $SNPS. $TSM is specifically highlighted as a critical and well-positioned 'neutral' supplier in the AI build-out, expected to benefit from massive data center spending through 2030. Healthcare companies $LLY and $NOVO-B face new policy-driven pricing pressure on their GLP-1 therapies in the US, following announced agreements to sharply reduce costs for Medicare and Medicaid patients. Miners $BHP.L and $GLEN are benefiting from strong commodity trends as copper nears record highs and iron ore prices advance on improving Chinese demand expectations. Chinese financial stocks $1919.HK and $2318.HK saw modest gains, supported by a general improvement in China's full-year 2025 GDP growth forecasts toward 5%.
