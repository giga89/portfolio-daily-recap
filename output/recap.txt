🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

USA markets are poised for a quiet open with $S&P 500 futures little changed and $NDAQ 100 futures slipping 0.2% in holiday-thinned trading following last week's rally. Asian equities were mixed, but China's $Shanghai Composite posted a modest gain of 0.4% as year-end flows continued. European stock futures point to a slightly higher open, with $Euro Stoxx 50 futures up 0.3%. The commodity sector saw dramatic movement as silver surged to a new all-time high, while gold pulled back more than 1% after reaching a fresh peak in the prior session.

💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

Semiconductor and AI-related stocks remain a central focus, with $TSM hitting a record high today after reports indicated the contract chipmaker will raise prices for its high-end chips starting January 1st due to tight global supply. The long-term outlook for the sector is exceptionally strong, with Bank of America forecasting a 30% jump in global semiconductor revenue in 2026, driven by AI infrastructure that benefits key holdings like $NVDA and $AVGO. While $MSFT, $AMZN, and $GOOG continue to dominate AI cloud, the narrative is expanding to AI software and data platforms, suggesting stocks like $PLTR and $NET may see a breakout year in 2026 as enterprises scale their solutions. In Healthcare, the broader GLP-1 drug trend continues to be a structural tailwind for major pharma names like $LLY and $NOVO-B, even as other defensive sectors like European Banks ($SX7PEX.DE) are expected to remain strong winners into next year.
