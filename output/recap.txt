🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

**1. 🌍 MARKET OVERVIEW**

Global markets kicked off the new year with a divergence in performance. European stocks surged to new record highs, with the Euro Stoxx 50 climbing over 0.69% on broad gains led by defense and industrial sectors. In the USA, a strong initial rally faded, leaving the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to close with fractional declines for the session. Asia saw mixed results, as the Shanghai Composite finished nearly flat while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rallied over 2%. The US dollar remained under pressure, which helped drive a continued rally in precious metals.

**2. 💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS**

The artificial intelligence theme dominated corporate news, with Baidu (BIDU) shares surging following its announcement of a registration for an IPO to spin off its AI chip unit, Kunlunxin. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) also posted a strong gain, extending its leadership in the technology sector. Conversely, consumer discretionary stocks faced pressure, highlighted by Tesla (TSLA) shares declining on reports of a second consecutive year of lower annual vehicle deliveries. Separately, Apple (AAPL) faced headwinds from news of production cutbacks for its Vision Pro headset due to struggling consumer adoption. The softer dollar environment fueled a robust rally in commodities, with gold and silver prices climbing significantly.
