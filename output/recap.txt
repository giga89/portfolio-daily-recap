🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

Global markets traded with a modest year-end pullback amid extremely thin holiday volumes, with US $S&P 500 and $Nasdaq 100 futures signaling a soft open, down 0.2% and 0.3% respectively. European bourses were similarly muted, as the Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.1% and France's CAC 40 declined 0.4% in early trading. In Asia, the $Shanghai Composite managed a marginal gain of 0.1%, contrasting with a 0.9% drop in the Hang Seng index, as investors booked profits on the final trading day of the year.

💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

The AI and chip sector, which includes $NVDA, $AVGO, $TSM, $MSFT, and $SNPS, saw a major catalyst with news of $NVDA's potential $20 billion acquisition of Groq's AI inferencing technology, positioning it for the next growth phase in AI adoption. In the GLP-1 space, $NOVO-B.CO submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for its once-weekly CagriSema combination for weight management, intensifying competition with $LLY. Separately, a new FDA-approved motion sickness drug is being developed to treat the nausea side effects of GLP-1 agonists, a development that could improve patient adherence for $LLY and $NOVO-B.CO products. Holdings in the broader Industrial, Financial ($DB1.DE, $PYPL, $MELI), and Energy ($CCJ, $GLEN.L, $ENEL.MI) sectors traded largely in line with their respective regional index movements in the quiet year-end session.
