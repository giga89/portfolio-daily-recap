🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

Global financial markets were universally closed today for the New Year's Day holiday, resulting in no trading activity for major indices including the $S&P 500, $Nasdaq, and the $Euro Stoxx. The focus has entirely shifted to policy announcements and economic forecasts for the year ahead, with all eyes now on the first trading session of 2026 tomorrow. Asian markets, including the Shanghai Composite, also observed the holiday, leaving volume at negligible levels worldwide. The lack of trading volume has led analysts to issue numerous sector outlooks, setting the stage for tomorrow’s open.

💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

With markets closed, attention is on the 2026 outlook for key sectors. The Healthcare cohort, including $AZN.L, $ABT, $ABBV, $LLY, and $NOVO-B.CO, is poised for continued growth based on new product pipelines and a strong M&A environment, with particular momentum expected in obesity and immunology treatments. AI and Semiconductor names like $NVDA, $TSM, $MSFT, $AVGO, and $SNPS are projected to remain secular growth leaders, with a fresh round of analyst upgrades highlighting sustained enterprise AI adoption. European utilities and infrastructure holdings, such as $ENEL.MI, $TRIG.L, and $SX7PEX.DE, are receiving positive outlooks based on stable dividend yields and government-backed green transition spending.
