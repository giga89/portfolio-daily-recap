🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

**1. 🌍 MARKET OVERVIEW**

Global markets began the new year with a broad risk-on rally, driven by optimism over AI and technology stocks as US markets reopened after the holiday. The $Nasdaq and $S&P 500 futures signaled a strong open, up 0.92% and 0.52% respectively, with US indices continuing that momentum in early trading. European indices surged, with the $FTSE 100 hitting an intraday record after crossing the 10,000 mark for the first time, while the $DAX and $CAC 40 gained around 0.5% to 0.8%. Trading in Mainland China ($Shanghai Composite) was closed, but the Hong Kong $Hang Seng Index jumped over 2.6% on a strong rally in local tech shares.

**2. 💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS**

The AI and semiconductor complex led the charge, with major holdings like $NVDA and $GOOG climbing more than 2% in early trading, fueling the strong performance of tech-focused ETFs like $IQQL.DE. The European rally provided an immediate tailwind for $IEUR, while the $FTSE 100’s record high was partly supported by a surge in precious metals miners, a positive signal for $GLEN.L. In the BioPharma space, $LLY and $NOVO-B.CO remain a primary focus as the market anticipates key 2026 catalysts, including a potential FDA decision on $NOVO-B.CO's Wegovy pill. The strong tech-led advance in Hong Kong provides a favorable backdrop for HK-listed holdings like $1919.HK and $2318.HK, despite the $Shanghai Composite holiday closure.
