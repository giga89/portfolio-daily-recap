🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

US markets began the new year with a strong open, as $S&P 500 futures rose 0.52% and $Nasdaq 100 futures surged 0.92% early in the session, supported by a stronger-than-expected labor market report showing US initial unemployment claims unexpectedly fell to a one-month low. Asia saw a significant rally on the first trading day, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumping over 2.5% driven by a surge in technology and AI-related stocks. European indexes opened mostly higher, though $Euro Stoxx 50 futures indicated a weaker start for the region.

💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

The AI and Chip sector is dominating the new year's open, providing a tailwind for major holdings like $NVDA, $AVGO, $TSM, $MSFT, $SNPS, $AMZN, and $GOOG, as a regional technology gauge rose to a record high on strong investor optimism. The tech-heavy $IQQL.DE ETF is benefiting directly from this strength, while other holdings like $PLTR and $NET will track the broader internet and cloud infrastructure sentiment. In the commodities space, $CCJ and $GLEN.L are supported by a strong start for precious metals, with spot gold and silver advancing significantly on the day, alongside a rise in WTI crude oil prices. European financials represented by $SX7PEX.DE remain sensitive to the mixed regional open, while the core Pharma holdings $LLY, $NOVO-B.CO, $ABT, $ABBV, $AZN.L, and $HUM are tracking general sector trends in the absence of major corporate news.
