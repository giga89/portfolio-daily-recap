🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

Global markets traded sideways in extremely thin, year-end volume as investors awaited the release of the Federal Reserve’s December meeting minutes later today. US $S&P 500 and $Nasdaq futures were flat, consolidating following a modest Monday pullback driven by profit-taking in megacap technology. Asia was mixed but saw strength in Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng climbing up to 1.0%, while the Chinese onshore Yuan strengthened past the key 7-per-dollar level for the first time in two years. European equities, including the $Euro Stoxx 50, were virtually unchanged, though the most notable move was a sharp rebound in precious metals, with Silver gaining over 5% after a steep Monday decline.

💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

The AI and Technology sector saw continued consolidation, with heavyweights like $MSFT, $AMZN, $GOOG, and $AVGO trading lower alongside $NVDA, which slipped over 1.2% on profit-taking. In the Healthcare sector, $LLY outperformed, rising 0.8% after data suggested its Mounjaro treatment provides faster and greater weight loss compared to $NOVO-B.CO's Wegovy, which declined 1.8%. Hong Kong-listed property stocks, including $1919.HK and $2318.HK, benefited from the broader Hang Seng strength and the positive Yuan movement. Energy and commodity-linked holdings like $CCJ and $GLEN.L were supported by a strong rally in crude oil and copper prices. $TSM, $SNPS, $PLTR, and $NET traded in line with the general AI/Tech sector weakness, while low-volume trading characterized exchange-linked names $DB1.DE and $ETOR.
