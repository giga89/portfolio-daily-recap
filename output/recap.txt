🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

Global financial markets, including the $S&P 500, $Nasdaq, and $Euro Stoxx, were universally closed today for the New Year's Day holiday, resulting in extremely limited trading activity. A key European policy event saw Bulgaria officially adopt the euro, becoming the 21st country to join the single currency. In trade news, China announced it will impose additional 55% tariffs on beef imports from key global suppliers, including the US and Australia, effective today.

💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

With no major company-specific news during the holiday, the focus remains on macro drivers for the portfolio's core holdings. The AI/Cloud infrastructure sector, including $NVDA, $AVGO, $MSFT, and $GOOG, enters the new year with strong momentum following $GOOG's best year since 2009 due to strengthening AI sentiment. Healthcare and Pharma holdings ($LLY, $NOVO-B.CO, $ABBV) are centered on upcoming Q4 earnings and continued legislative uncertainty regarding drug pricing. China's new tariffs on beef imports could increase trade friction, which is a macro headwind for global commodity traders like $GLEN.L and the Asian financial sector ($1919.HK, $2318.HK). The auto sector ($RACE, $VOW3.DE) is watching for new EV sales data and the impact of the EU's policy shift on the energy transition, which also impacts $ENEL.MI and $TRIG.L.
