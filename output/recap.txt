🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

Global markets closed out the final trading day of the year on a soft note amid extremely thin holiday volumes. US indices declined, with the $S&P 500 falling 0.33% and the $Nasdaq 100 down 0.34%, primarily driven by weakness in chip and data storage stocks. European stocks were also slightly lower, with the Euro Stoxx 50 easing 0.08%, while China's Shanghai Composite showed resilience, climbing 0.1% following stronger-than-expected December Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI data. The unexpected drop in US weekly jobless claims to a one-month low was a hawkish factor contributing to higher bond yields and pressure on equities.

💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

The AI and Semiconductor cohort, including $NVDA, $TSM, $AVGO, $MSFT, $SNPS, $AMZN, and $GOOG, faced selling pressure, as chip stocks led the broader $Nasdaq decline. The Healthcare sector, featuring $LLY and $NOVO-B.CO, continued to be driven by the prevailing narrative of $LLY's dominance in the GLP-1 weight-loss drug market, sustaining investor focus on the long-term growth story. The Uranium and Nuclear power theme, which impacts $CCJ and $TRIG.L, remains a significant catalyst, supported by the ongoing demand for energy from AI data centers. European Financials and Chinese H-Shares, including $SX7PEX.DE, $DB1.DE, $1919.HK, and $2318.HK, traded in muted year-end volumes, while other holdings like $RACE, $MELI, and $PYPL consolidated recent gains.
