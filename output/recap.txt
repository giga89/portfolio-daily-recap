🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

**🌍 MARKET OVERVIEW**
Global equities are muted in holiday-thinned trading as the year-end "Santa Claus rally" takes a pause. US stock futures are slightly lower, with $NDAQ 100 futures slipping 0.2% after a strong run last week, while $S&P 500 futures remain little changed. European markets are pointing cautiously higher as $Euro Stoxx 50 futures advanced 0.3% in early trading. In Asia, the $Shanghai Composite was virtually unchanged, but the broader MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.3%, boosted by tech and industrials.

**💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS**
The AI/Semiconductor complex remains a key focus, with $AVGO reporting a backlog for its AI switches exceeding $10 billion, driven by record demand for its latest Tomahawk 6 chip. $NVDA is also in the spotlight following a new strategic, non-exclusive license agreement with AI chipmaker Groq, a move valued up to $20 billion to integrate Groq’s inference technology and enhance its position in the AI ecosystem. For the healthcare holdings, the trend continues to favor the pharmaceutical sector's exposure to the emerging GLP-1 therapies and domestic markets over US pricing pressures, which impacts $LLY, $NOVO-B, $ABT, $ABBV, $AZN.L, and $HUM. European banking exposure via $SX7PEX.DE is supported by analysts maintaining a positive outlook on the sector's valuation and capital positions. The broader AI-driven boom in digital infrastructure continues to provide tailwinds for enterprise tech names like $MSFT, $GOOG, $AMZN, $PLTR, and $NET.
