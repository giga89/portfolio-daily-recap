🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

Global markets opened the new year with an AI-driven rally, though US indices saw early gains fade into a mixed session. The S&P 500 opened higher but ended down 0.1%, while the Nasdaq composite also retreated, closing 0.3% lower, despite a strong start from technology stocks. European bourses saw a powerful open, with the Euro Stoxx 50 climbing 0.55% to a new record high and the FTSE 100 surging 1.0% to cross the 10,000 mark for the first time. In Asia, the Hang Seng Index jumped 2.8%, fueled by optimism surrounding Chinese technology firms' AI chip advancements and IPO filings.

💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

NVIDIA (NVDA) was a major market driver, with shares up over 1% as the company reportedly surpassed a 4.5 trillion market capitalization, overtaking both Apple and Microsoft. The chipmaker also requested a boost in H200 production from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) to meet strong projected Chinese demand for 2026. Microsoft (MSFT) shares declined 0.8% as the stock lagged the broader tech rally, despite analyst optimism regarding the growth potential of its Azure cloud platform. Apple (AAPL) also saw a modest decline of 0.45%, with its AI strategy remaining a point of market skepticism, though its long-term AI monetization potential is still viewed positively.
