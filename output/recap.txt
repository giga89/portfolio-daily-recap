🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

USA markets saw a marginal pullback on Friday in holiday-thinned trading, with the $SPX closing down less than 0.1% at 6,929.94 and the $NDAQ slipping 0.1% as investors took profits following recent record highs. Precious metals, however, extended their year-long rally, with Gold and Silver surging to fresh all-time highs on geopolitical uncertainty and expectations of further Fed rate cuts. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite in China edged up 0.1% to 3,963.68, while most major European indices, including the Euro Stoxx, were closed for the Christmas holiday.

💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

The AI and Technology sector, including $NVDA, $MSFT, $AVGO, $AMZN, and $GOOG, remains a primary market driver with generative AI becoming mainstream for business automation and efficiency. Healthcare holdings like $LLY, $NOVO-B, $ABBV, and $AZN.L are positioned for a robust period, driven by renewed market momentum and the accelerated adoption of AI in diagnostics and drug discovery. The Energy complex, impacting $BHP.L, $GLEN, and $CCJ, is navigating a complex landscape where the rapid growth in AI power demand is reviving interest in nuclear power and increasing commodity allocation. $PLTR and $NET benefit from the broader trend of enterprise AI adoption, while $PYPL and $DB1.DE are in a finance sector seeing high AI implementation for efficiency and innovation.
