🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

**🌍 MARKET OVERVIEW**
US markets are consolidating, with both the $S&P 500 and $Nasdaq 100 trading down about -0.24% as investors booked profits in megacap technology stocks. European markets were marginally positive, with the $Euro Stoxx 50 up around +0.15% in quiet, holiday-thinned trading. China's $Shanghai Composite posted a modest gain of +0.04%, marking its ninth straight day of gains following a government pledge for broader fiscal spending in the new year. Crude oil futures surged over 2%, lifting the broader Energy sector.

**💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS**
Megacap Technology and AI holdings, including $NVDA, $MSFT, $AMZN, and $GOOG, are seeing a slight pullback, driving the broader US index weakness today. The Uranium and Nuclear sector, including $CCJ, is maintaining bullish momentum as futures trade above $80/lb, supported by strong peer production updates and global nuclear demand projections. Diversified miner $GLEN.L is receiving a tailwind from the more than 2% rise in crude oil prices, which is supporting the commodities complex. The Healthcare sector, including $LLY, $NOVO-B.CO, $ABT, and $ABBV, continues to be underpinned by the high-growth narrative surrounding GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. European and emerging market holdings like $ENEL.MI, $RACE, and $IEMG are seeing muted activity in line with the quiet global trading environment.
