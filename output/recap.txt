🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

Global equities began the week mixed in quiet, holiday-thinned trading, as investors consolidated gains from a strong year-end rally. US $S&P 500 futures slipped 0.2% ahead of the open, while European stock futures pointed slightly higher. Asia saw mixed results, with China's $Shanghai Composite flat, but roaring AI demand helped South Korea's Kospi index jump 2.2%. Macro data confirmed China's trade resilience, with its total trade surplus hitting a record $1 trillion this year, driven by robust exports to the EU and African markets.

💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

The AI and semiconductor complex remains a key focus for investors, with $NVDA, $AVGO, and $TSM continuing to benefit from the "roaring AI demand" highlighted in fresh global trade reports. Healthcare names $LLY and $NOVO-B are navigating an increasingly competitive GLP-1 market, with recent analyst reports citing the risk of knockoff versions and intense rivalry pressuring guidance. Commodity and mining holdings $BHP.L and $GLEN were supported by expectations for stronger demand from Chinese steel mills, pushing copper and iron ore prices higher. European-tracking funds $IEUR and $SX7PEX.DE are following the modest positive signal from EU futures, while $IEMG is mixed, reflecting a strong gain in South Korea against a decline in Hong Kong. Core Big Tech stocks like $AMZN, $GOOG, and $MSFT saw marginal movement in thin trading, but the sector's long-term growth story remains intact.
