💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

Strong European market performance, with the Euro Stoxx 600 hitting a record high, bolstered $IEUR and $SX7PEXDE, while a massive analyst upgrade for ASML signaled strong future demand for TSM. The healthcare sector remains in focus as NOVO-B.CO and LLY continue to capitalize on GLP-1 drug momentum, with ABBV and AZN.L poised for favorable growth in 2026. Miners like GLEN.L and TRX received a major boost from the rally in precious metals, with silver jumping nearly 5% and gold gaining 1.4%. Emerging market exposure $IEMG was supported by positive Chinese manufacturing data and a strong rally in the Hong Kong market, contributing to the overall positive sentiment captured by $WDEFL.
