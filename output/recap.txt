🌍 MARKET NEWS RECAP

Global financial markets were largely closed for the New Year's Day holiday, severely limiting major index trading in the US and Europe. The $S&P 500 and $Euro Stoxx saw no activity, with attention shifting to overnight commodity moves. The $Shanghai Composite, however, provided a final data point, managing a slight gain, closing up 0.1% at 3,968.84. Gold prices remain a macro focus after recording an astonishing annual gain of approximately 64% in 2025, while oil prices ended the year down nearly 20%.

💼 PORTFOLIO FOCUS

The AI/Semiconductor complex, including $NVDA and $TSM, is poised for a strong start to 2026 following reports that $NVDA is ramping up production for its H200 AI chips in a dramatic push to meet Chinese orders exceeding 2 million units for the year. Broader AI-driven demand for high-bandwidth memory chips is expected to accelerate a supply crunch, potentially driving consumer electronics prices up by 5% to 20% in 2026. In Healthcare, $ABT, $ABBV, $LLY, and $HUM face new policy dynamics as Medicare's first negotiated drug prices under the Inflation Reduction Act take effect today for ten high-cost drugs, alongside tightened prior authorization rules for Medicare Advantage plans. The Uranium sector, anchored by $CCJ, is supported by Bank of America's $135/lb uranium price target for 2026, driven by rising nuclear demand from the $AI revolution's massive power needs. European utilities, including $ENEL.MI, are set to benefit from the new EU Grids Package, an initiative to accelerate grid modernization and cross-border energy highway projects.
